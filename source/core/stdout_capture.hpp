/**
 * Sends everything written to stdout and stderr to the OTLP exporter.
 *
 * The gap this closes
 * -------------------
 * The OTLP exporter subscribes to the borealis log event, so it sees exactly
 * what the app chose to log through brls::Logger and nothing else. Large
 * parts of a Moonlight session are not that: moonlight-common-c, ffmpeg and
 * libnx all write with printf, and none of it reaches the log event. A
 * developer running nxlink sees those lines; a console owner does not.
 *
 * nxlink itself is only
 *
 *     dup2(sock, STDOUT_FILENO);
 *     dup2(sock, STDERR_FILENO);
 *
 * pointing the two descriptors at a TCP socket back to a PC. This does the
 * same interception without the PC: it swaps the device behind those
 * descriptors for one that assembles lines and hands them to the exporter,
 * which is how libnx's own consoleInit redirects stdout to the screen.
 *
 * Opt in
 * ------
 * Off unless <config dir>/otel-capture-stdout exists, and a no-op if the
 * exporter has no endpoint.
 *
 * Akira only points the borealis logger at a file when the user has turned
 * file logging on. Until that has happened borealis is still writing to
 * stdout, and capturing then would export every log line twice, so install()
 * must not be called before the caller has moved it. See main.cpp.
 *
 * Being on costs bandwidth and buffer on a path that can produce thousands
 * of lines a second during a stream, so it is a debugging mode rather than
 * something to leave running.

 * a capture with nowhere to send is pointless, and after any

 * Not reversible. There is no uninstall: the devoptab entry has to outlive
 * every FILE that might still be flushed during shutdown, and swapping it
 * back while another thread is mid write is a worse problem than leaving it.
