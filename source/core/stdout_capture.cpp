/*
 * Threading and re-entrancy
 * -------------------------
 * printf can be called from any thread, so the partial line buffers are
 * shared state and need a lock.
 *
 * There is deliberately no thread_local here, and no thread_local guard
 * against re-entering this function. OtlpLogExporter.cpp documents why: a
 * thread_local store faults on a thread spawned on this platform, because
 * TPIDR_EL0 is zero and the generated code offsets straight off it. That rule
 * applies to this file for the same reason.
 *
 * Re-entrancy is therefore prevented by construction rather than by a guard.
 * Nothing below writes to stdout or stderr: it appends to a std::string, and
 * calls OtlpLogExporter::logRaw, which takes a mutex, pushes onto a deque and
 * bumps counters. If anything on that path ever gains a printf, this becomes
 * an infinite recursion, and the lock below turns it into a deadlock instead.
 * Keep it silent.
 *
 * Note also that brls::Logger must never be called from here. borealis writes
 * the formatted line to logOut before firing its event, and fires that event
 * while holding logMtx; logging from this path would both feed the capture
 * its own output and deadlock on a non recursive mutex.
